## Gameplay

The object of the game is to score as many points as possible until the player misses 3 shots.

The player can move towards or away from the basket using the left/right arrow keys and adjust the angle of the shot using the up/down arrow keys. Hold the spacebar to accumulate power and and release to shoot the ball. Shots behind the 3 point line are worth, you guessed it, 3 points.

## Features

The game uses projectile motion to move ball & collision detection to bounce ball off obstacles.
The power bar increases in size as the spacebar is held down until hitting a predefined maximum power.
